The **Phishing.Database** project is a comprehensive and regularly updated repository designed to help the community identify and mitigate phishing threats.

We believe that threat intelligence on phishing, malware, and ransomware should always remain **free and open-source**. By openly sharing data about criminal activities, we aim to protect the internet users, help organizations mitigate threats, and contribute to a safer online environment for everyone by contributing to the global effort to identify and shutdown malicious sites. Unlike proprietary systems that sell access to phishing data, we focus and on transparency and collaboration for the greater good.

Join us in our mission to keep threat intelligence free and open-source by contributing to the project, sharing the data, and supporting the maintainers.
